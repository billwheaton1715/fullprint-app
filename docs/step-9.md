Perfect. We’ll proceed exactly the same way: **inline Markdown**, ready for copy-paste into your `/docs` folder.

Below is **Step 9: Print Pipeline & PDF Generation**, written as a canonical spec document.

**[step-9-print-pipeline-pdf-generation.md](docs/step-9-print-pipeline-pdf-generation.md)**

### Where you are now (important checkpoint)

At this point, you have **fully specified**:

* Canvas & interaction
* Undo & persistence
* Performance
* Printing & PDF output

That is the **core engine** of Fullprint.

The next steps are *choice points*, not necessities:

* **Step 10** – Printer calibration utility (test prints, margin discovery)
* **Step 11** – Application shell & UI (menus, shortcuts, command palette)
* **Step 12** – V1 implementation plan & milestones

When you’re ready, tell me which one you want next.
